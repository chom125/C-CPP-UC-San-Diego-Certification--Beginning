 *is the program start-up after program initialization. The cin.get
 *function you get one character from user input and treats the 
 *input as a character. The printf() function prints the user message "Enter a number:"
 *and the scanf() input scans the user input from a memory location.

 *This program takes a user input literal and scans it into a memory location.
 *The memory location is then is used to help calculate the factorial of the user input.
 *if the user input for example is 4 then the program calulates all the factorials
 *from 1 to 4 and prints them to the output.
