/*This program uses a function ComputerMinimum and ComputerMaximum which returns the minimum

 *into the 2 given user inputs val1 and val2 respectively. The following specifications
 *are also included in this program:
 *ComputerMinimum and ComputerMaximum must compare the values referenced by its parameters;
 *and return a reference to the smallest or largest varible depending on the function used
 *ComputerMaximum or ComputerMinimum. Also the  program must adhere to the the following:
 *Use tow formal parameters, each of type "reference to const double";
 *Return type "reference to double" (do not "reference to const double"); Use only one statement;
 *Don't use variables other than their formal parameters; Don't use #define or #include; Don't
 *use literal values. Don't use add, subtract, multiply, or divide; 
 *Don't use the case or switch statements; 
 *Don't call function or macros;
 *Don't display anything;
