 *
 *The program uses the function, main() to mark the start of the beginning of the program
 *The program also uses the cout, and cin and the function, PrintLines1() function
 *that passes the inputs and displays the input character in rows and columns given by the 
 *user input of one input character and two input integers.

/*The program prompts user input of one character and two numbers and displays and the 
 * the user input character of numbers and rows input by the users input. The functions 
 *then print out the appropriate displays. Also, the program has the following criteria: 
 *prompts the to enter thre inputs one character, and two numbers.
 *display the inoput character, and the number of lines of columns and rows of the character
 *base on the user input. Makes the following calls in order passing the appropriate entries 
 *PrintLines(charcterToDisplay, numberOfCharacters, numberOfLines), PrintLines(charcterToDisplay, 
 *numberOfCharacters), PrintLines(charcterToDisplay), and PrintLines(charcterToDisplay); 
 *The program also has test input to ensure the program is working properly. The test inputs 
 *are as follows: U 20 10, V 0 10, W 25 0, X 25 1, and Y 150 3.
