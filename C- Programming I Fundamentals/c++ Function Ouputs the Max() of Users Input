 *beginning of the program. Also, the function ComputeMinimum which calculates the 
 *minimum value and returns the minimum value from a pointer either p1 or p2. 
 *
 *The program also has the following criteria: It has only two formal parameters const 
 *double and double and has no other parameters. The pointer does not ever point to const 
 *double. There is no #define or include in this program and no addition, subtraction, 
 *multiplication or division. The program also does not use a switch or if loop. Lastly 
 *the program does not call any macros
