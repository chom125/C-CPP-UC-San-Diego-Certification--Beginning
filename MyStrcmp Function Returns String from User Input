 *The function main() to mark the startup of the program after initialization The program 
 *also uses the function fgets() which reads characters from the input stream and stores 
 *its values as a C string into "str" until (num -1) characters have been read or either 
 *a newline or the end-of-file is reached or whichever happens first. The function strcmp() 
 *is also used which compares two null-terminated byte strings lexicographically.
 *
 *The main program prompts the user to enter a string and through the call of the function
 *MyStrlen() and strlen() the program returns the user inputted string and the count of 
 *the number of characters in that string. 
 *
 *The function to compares the two strings Compares two strings lexicographically;
