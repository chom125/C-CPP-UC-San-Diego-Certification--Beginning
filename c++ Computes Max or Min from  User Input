/*The program has several functions which are as follows: The main() function

 *which are functions which calculate the maximum and minimum of two user
 *inputs and returns either the maximum or minimum inputs.
 *
 *The program computes the maximum or minimum value between two user imputed values. 
 *The program compares the two imputed values given by the user and computes the maximum 
 *input and returns that maximum or minimum computed values. The return function returns 
 *the recorded values for both ComputeMaximum and ComputeMinimum and returns both the max and
 *minimum numbers. The functions that compute the maximum or minim values are two functions 
 *called ComputeMaximum or ComputeMinimum The program also will reference a const double data 
 *type but return only a double type value. The program does not return any other data type 
 *other than a double type. The program also does not use #define or #include or any literal 
 *values. The functions that are created in this program does not call any functions or macros.
